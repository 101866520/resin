As the Google AV was completing a lane change in autonomous mode from the far right lane to the middle lane of El Camino Real near the intersection of Showers Drive, a car stopped in traffic in the far left lane of El Camino Real abruptly changed lanes into the middle lane, immmediately in front of the Google AV. The Google AV test driver took manual control of the Google AV and quickly merged back into the far right lane to avoid the vehicle. Another vehicle approaching from behind in the right lane of El Camino Real then struck the rear passenger side quarter panel of the Google AV at approximately 23 mph. The Google AV was traveling at approximately 14 mph at the time of the collision. The Google AV sustained minor damage to its rear passenger-side tire, quarter panel, and door. The other vehicle sustained moderate damage to its front bumper and front driver-side fender. There were no injuries reported at the scene by either party.",

        "description": "A Google Lexus-model autonomous vehicle ('Google AV') traveling northbound on Phyllis Ave. in Mountain View in manual mode was invovled in an accident. As the Google AV proceeded through a green light at the El Camino Real intersection, its autonomous technology detected another vehicle traveling westbound on El Camino Real approaching the intersection at 30 mph and began to apply the Google AV's brakes in anticipation that the other vehicle would run through the red light. The Google AV test test driver then disengaged the autonomous technology and took manual control of the Google AV. Immediately thereafter, the other vehicle ran through the red light and collided with the right side of the Google AV at 30 mph. At the time of collision, the Google AV was traveling at 22mph. The Google AV sustained substantial damage to its front and rear passenger dorrs. The other vehicle sustained significant damage to its front end. There were no injuries reported at the scene by either party. However, the Google AV test driver later voluntarily went to a local hospital where he was evaluated by medical staff and released.",
